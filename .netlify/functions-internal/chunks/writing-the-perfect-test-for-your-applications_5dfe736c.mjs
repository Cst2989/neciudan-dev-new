You would write an e2e that simulates the flow for you.\n\nHaving the test ready, here’s how to use it to find the commit that introduced a bug:\n\n1. Start the bisect process by running `git bisect start`.\n2. Identify a commit that is known to be “good”, and run `git bisect good <commit>`.\n3. Identify a commit that is known to be “bad”, and run `git bisect bad <commit>`.\n4. Git will then check out a commit that is halfway between the good and bad commits.\n5. Run your test to determine whether the current commit is good or bad. If it is good, run `git bisect good`. If it is bad, run `git bisect bad`.\n6. Repeat this process until git bisect finds the commit that introduced the bug.\n7. When git bisect has found the commit, it will output the commit hash and message.\n8. Run git bisect reset to stop the bisect process and return to the HEAD commit.\n\nAutomating this process will save you hours and hours of checking commit histories, especially if the bug was introduced months ago and you have a very big codebase.\n\n## The Test that helps you Sleep well at night\n<img src=\"/images/articles/sleep.jpg\" alt=\"The Test that helps you Sleep well at night\" /> \n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Photo by bruce mars on Unsplash</p>\n\nEngineers love complexity.\n\nLike building software that does things, nobody or no other software has done before.\n\nAnd the same is true for our automation processes.
