In each round, called a frame, you have two tries. If you knock them over on the first try, it’s called a strike, if you do it in two it’s called a spare.

Like this:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"/images/articles/bowling0.png\"> \n</p>\n<p>From the description and examples we can gather a couple of insights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We receive an array of numbers as input and expect a number, the total score, as output.</li>\n<li>A strike is always followed by the number 0.</li>\n<li>The length of the rolls array is 20 and in the case of a strike / spare on the last frame, it’s 21.</li>\n<li>A frame is composed of two throws and the game is composed of ten frames.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With this in mind we can start coding our solution, and the first step of that is to write some unit tests.</p>\n<h3 id=\"starting-with-unit-tests\">Starting with Unit tests</h3>\n<p>Starting with unit tests first is a must-have for any interview process. You don’t have to practice <a href=\"https://www.browserstack.com/guide/what-is-test-driven-development\">TDD</a> regularly at work, or follow the <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/articles/tdd-red-green-refactor\">Red, Green, Refactor framework</a> rigorously, but writing the tests first helps you think in small increments about a problem.</p>\n<p>All of a sudden you don’t have to solve a big complex problem, you have to solve multiple small problems and you can take them one at a time.</p>\n<p>And by writing unit tests you can showcase your thinking process outside of your coding skills. Interviewers are very interested to see a candidate think about error boundaries in a problem and handle it accordantly.</p>\n<p>From the requirements we can gather a couple of invalid inputs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When the input rolls length is lower than 20</li>\n<li>When the input rolls length is bigger than 21</li>\n<li>When we have negative numbers among the input rolls</li>\n<li>When two rolls in a frame have a sum bigger than 10 (there are only 10 pins you can hit)</li>\n<li>When following a strike you have another number other than 0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just by thinking about error boundaries, it also helped us with our design, because to test against them we have to code in a specific, granular way.</p>\n<p>For example, to test that two rolls in a frame have a sum bigger than 10, we now deduce that we need a function that handles the logic for a specific frame.</p>\n<p>Pointing these invalid inputs out to the interviewer will score you massive points, but please keep in mind that you are on limited time. So you can code one or two but have the bigger picture in mind. Nothing is worse that having the interviewer stop you to let you know you have 5 more minutes left.</p>\n<h3 id=\"getting-started\">Getting started</h3>\n<p>Assuming our starting function is something like this:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"/images/articles/bowling1.png\"> \n</p>\n<p>Let’s write our first test to protect ourselves against invalid inputs:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"/images/articles/bowling2.png\"> \n</p>\n<p>Quick tips regarding testing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow the AAA (ARRANGE, ACT, ASSERT) pattern when writing test</li>\n<li>Only have one Assert per unit test</li>\n<li>When testing and coding and debugging you can use helper functions to focus only one test or block of tests</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"/images/articles/bowling3.png\"> \n</p>\n<p>Coming back to our first test case, we need to code a solution for when we have too few rolls as our input.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"/images/articles/bowling4.png\"> \n</p>\n<p>Running the tests with the focus on our first test will return our first green.
