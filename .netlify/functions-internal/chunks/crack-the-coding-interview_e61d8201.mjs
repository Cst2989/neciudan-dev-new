Here are the best of the best.\n\n## Cracking the Algorithm Challange\n\nAlgorithmic problems are a little outdated but there are still companies who use them, either through a home tests platform like Codility or a pre-interview with 2‚Äì3 exercises.\n\nBig O Nation resources:\n\n- [A begginer guide to big O](https://robbell.io/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation)\n- [Big O CheatSheet](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com)\n- [MIT Free Courses](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?q=algorithms&type=course)\n\nPractices websites:\n\n- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/\n- https://leetcode.com/\n- https://www.hackerrank.com/\n- https://adventofcode.com/ and the /r/adventofcode\n- https://www.codewars.com/\n\nExtra:\n\n- https://algorithm-visualizer.org/ (A tool that helps you visualize how famous algorithms work)\n- [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22847284-grokking-algorithms-an-illustrated-guide-for-programmers-and-other-curio?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=O9r64GRClJ&rank=7)\n\n## Cracking the Frontend Tech Call\n\nA technical interview is usually the first real test for any interviewing process. Usually, if you fail, that‚Äôs it, game over.\n\nIn the frontend world, there are a lot of bloggers and tech writers who explain a lot of Javascript concepts really really well.\n\nHere are my favorites:\n\n- Dmitri Pavlutin likes to write about React, Javascript, and general design patterns. I would really recommend his article explaining this in Javascript.\n- Dan Abramov is the creator of Redux and a Core Member of the React Development Team. He likes to write about best practices in React but also about classic interview questions like let vs const. Dan also has a nice course about Javascript Mental Models called Just Javascript\n- If you are interviewing for a Vue.js position, check out Fotis Adamakis, he writes about everything Vue related from State Management, how harmful Mixins are, but also about Vue 3 mistakes you should avoid doing.\n- Lydia Hallie is also an amazing writer who likes to illustrate visualization of javascript concepts. Her Javascript Visualised series is one of my favorites\n- Another favorite of mine is Josh Comeau, he likes to write about React and CSS but he also has two amazing courses (The Joy of React and CSS for JS Developers) that, while not FREE, I would recommend 100%.\n\nExtra:\n\nI also enjoy these humourous but also educational youtube channels:\n\n- [FireShip](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship)\n- [The Se√±or Developer](https://www.youtube.com/@theSenorDeveloper)\n- [Tim Benniks](https://www.youtube.com/@timbenniks)\n\n## Cracking the Live Coding Interview\n\nThe live coding interview or a week-long home assignment is where you get to showcase your coding skills.\n\nThere are 3 pillars that you need to tick to impress during this process:\n\n- Typescript\n- Testing\n- Clean Code\n\nHere are some GitHub repositories and projects that can help you excel at this part:\n\n- JavaScript30: This repository contains 30 mini projects, each focusing on a different aspect of JavaScript, such as arrays, loops, and fetch API.\n- You Don‚Äôt Know JS (YDKJS): This is a series of books diving deep into the core mechanisms of the JavaScript language, written by Kyle Simpson.\n- Awesome JavaScript: A curated list of useful JavaScript resources, including tutorials, libraries, and tools.\n- JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures: A repository containing JavaScript implementations of common algorithms and data structures, such as sorting, searching, and graph algorithms.\n- JavaScript Design Patterns: A collection of design patterns and best practices for writing maintainable and scalable JavaScript code.\n\nAnd here are some amazing Typescript Resources:\n\n- TotalTypescript has 2 amazing beginner tutorials and one paid version.\n- Typescript Handbook\n- Typescript Type Challenges\n\nI would also like to recommend some Reddit subreddits like:\n\n- /r/programming\n- /r/javascript\n- /r/typescript\n\n## Cracking the System Design Interview\n\nOne of the hardest interviews for Frontend Engineers.\n\nTo truly master this part I would recommend the book System Design Interview by Alex Xu but also his Youtube Channel ByteByteGo\n\nOther amazing resources are:\n\n- Patterns.dev\n- Web.dev\n- Smacss.com\n- Design Systems Handbook\n- Smashing Magazine\n\nAnd here are some case studies:\n\nüëâ Design Messenger App : https://bit.ly/3DoAAXi\n\nüëâ Design Reddit: https://bit.ly/3OgGJrL\n\nüëâ Design Netflix: https://bit.ly/3GrAUG1\n\nüëâ Design Instagram: https://bit.ly/3BFeHlh\n\nüëâ Design Dropbox: https://bit.ly/3SnhncU\n\nüëâ Design Youtube: https://bit.ly/3dFyvvy\n\nüëâ Design Tinder: https://bit.ly/3Mcyj3X\n\nüëâ Design Yelp: https://bit.ly/3E7IgO5\n\nüëâ Design Whatsapp: https://bit.ly/3M2GOhP\n\nüëâ Design URL shortener : https://bit.ly/3xP078x\n\nüëâ Design Amazon Prime Video: https://bit.ly/3hVpWP4\n\nüëâ Design Twitter: https://bit.ly/3qIG9Ih\n\nüëâ Design Uber: https://bit.ly/3fyvnlT\n\nAll of these may seem intimidating, but if you build a habit, of one article each day, writing down what you find interesting using post-it notes, the knowledge you gain will compound and you will get your dream job in no time.\n\nAnd you can check on levels, who is hiring at the moment.\n\nIn the end, I will leave you with this Japanese proverb:\n\n‚ÄúNana korobi, ya oki‚Äù which means ‚ÄúFall down seven times, stand up eight.‚Äù\n";
