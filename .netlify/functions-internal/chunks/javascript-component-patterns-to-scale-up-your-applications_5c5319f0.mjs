If your feature is a money-making feature for your app, a core functionality that makes your business stand out against your competitors then you can categorize it as a Core Feature.</p>\n<p><em>Core Features</em> tend to change, a lot, so you have to apply extra care when building and modifying the underline components to keep them readable and extensible.</p>\n<p>If your Feature is more of a utility function, or something similar, then you can classify it as a Support Feature. This category rarely changes, once you build it and unit test it, odds are you will never touch it again—for example, the Base Modal in your app that extends all the other modals.</p>\n<p><em>Generic Features</em> on the hand, are features that every app has, like Authentication and Login, the Shopping Cart in an e-commerce application, etc. These features are in the middle of the might change spectrum.</p>\n<p>So when we start a new feature or modify an existing one, take some time to categorize it and try to apply the component pattern that works better with it.</p>\n<p>This way, you may save your future self and colleagues a lot of hassle in the future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"container--presentational-pattern\">Container — Presentational Pattern</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"/images/articles/cp-pattern.png\" alt=\"Container Presentational Workflow\"> \n</p>\n<p>One of the most popular component patterns there is, and a lot of people are using it without knowing its name or its benefits.

Made popular by Airbnb, this design pattern is very useful when you have one API for multiple clients.

Some are purely logic components and some are just presentational.</p>\n<p>Technically it is a combination of the previous patterns, plus a little extra in the form of data providers. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves, let’s start with the basics.</p>\n<p>First, you have to split your components into three types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Layout Components (responsible of the layout of the feature)</li>\n<li>Composables (responsible with the logic of the feature)</li>\n<li>Renderless Components. (responsible with mixing and matching the other two types of componenets)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s go through each of them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"layout-components\">Layout Components</h3>\n<p>Going back to the container/presentation pattern, imagine you are building your feature, but you don’t know if you have the best design + functionality for your users.</p>\n<p>Some users prefer a more minimalistic design with fewer features, while others need more information and a design that captures their attention.</p>\n<p>Let’s build an imaginary feature.</p>\n<p>Think of an input that adds your address in your favorite food delivery app. You have a button that opens a modal with a map and you can select your location. You also have a text input where you can write your address.</p>\n<p>We want to A/B test variations of this input, design-wise but also logic-wise. In one variation we want the input with the location button and in another with more text and without this button.</p>\n<p>Here are some screenshots of what we want:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"/images/articles/screenshots.webp\" alt=\"Mobile Screenshots\"> \n</p>\n<p>Now, you might think the best solution is just to create two separate container components using the same presentational component. And in theory, we are doing just that, but we also want to separate the design part from the logic.</p>\n<p>Because tomorrow, a new design may want to be implemented for our feature, and we don’t want to have multiple containers with the same logic inside. <em>DRY = Don’t Repeat Yourself is our motto.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"composables--hooks\">Composables / Hooks</h3>\n<p>Here is where the logic resides. Instead of having logic and layout in the same Container component, we split them into different types of components.</p>\n<p>For each feature logic we have, we create composables or hooks in the React world.</p>\n<p>These are pieces of logic, encapsulated, and reusable that do not return any HTML.</p>\n<p>Keeping with our Address Input Feature, we identify 3 distinct logical components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The logic where we get the user’s current location based on the Browser location data.</li>\n<li>The logic where we open the Location Modal once the user taps the button</li>\n<li>The logic to render the input, if the user already has an address or not.</li>\n<li>The logic of deciding when the input becomes sticky in the header.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We extract each of them into their own composable. For example:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"/images/articles/composable1.webp\" alt=\"Composable Example\"> \n</p>\n<p>Another example of a composable, is data providers. Maybe inside your feature you need access to some piece of data, either from a redux store or from another part of the application.</p>\n<p>To not pollute our feature component with props that some part of the feature might not use or pass props around from child to parent, we create a ProviderComponent that gets the data and pass it along to the interested component.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of a data provider:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"/images/articles/composable2.webp\" alt=\"Composable Example\"> \n</p>\n<h3 id=\"renderless-container-components\">Renderless Container Components</h3>\n<p>It’s important to think of Composables and Layout components as our lego bricks. And it’s time to put everything together.</p>\n<p>Using Renderless Container Components, we can mix and match as many layouts with the necessary logic, and provide information using data providers.</p>\n<p>The end result is a feature that is split into tiny atomic particles that can be mixed and matched as much as possible.</p>\n<p>Even better, if you need in the future to change your component, you do not modify the original. You just create a new variant, using either another layout, or adding another composable and so on…</p>\n<p>There are downsides of course….</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"/images/articles/downside.png\" alt=\"Component Hell\"> \n</p>\n<p>You would most certainly end up with something like this. The end result is not pretty but it is sure as hell very powerful.</p>\n<p>When building a core business feature, take this pattern into account. It could save you a lot of time and resources.</p>";

Instead of having logic and layout in the same Container component, we split them into different types of components.\n\nFor each feature logic we have, we create composables or hooks in the React world.\n\nThese are pieces of logic, encapsulated, and reusable that do not return any HTML.\n\nKeeping with our Address Input Feature, we identify 3 distinct logical components:\n\n- The logic where we get the user's current location based on the Browser location data.\n- The logic where we open the Location Modal once the user taps the button\n- The logic to render the input, if the user already has an address or not.\n- The logic of deciding when the input becomes sticky in the header.\n\nWe extract each of them into their own composable. For example:\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"/images/articles/composable1.webp\" alt=\"Composable Example\" /> \n</p>\n\nAnother example of a composable, is data providers. Maybe inside your feature you need access to some piece of data, either from a redux store or from another part of the application.\n\nTo not pollute our feature component with props that some part of the feature might not use or pass props around from child to parent, we create a ProviderComponent that gets the data and pass it along to the interested component.\n\nHere is an example of a data provider:\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"/images/articles/composable2.webp\" alt=\"Composable Example\" /> \n</p>\n\n### Renderless Container Components\n\nIt’s important to think of Composables and Layout components as our lego bricks. And it’s time to put everything together.\n\nUsing Renderless Container Components, we can mix and match as many layouts with the necessary logic, and provide information using data providers.\n\nThe end result is a feature that is split into tiny atomic particles that can be mixed and matched as much as possible.\n\nEven better, if you need in the future to change your component, you do not modify the original. You just create a new variant, using either another layout, or adding another composable and so on…\n\nThere are downsides of course….\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"/images/articles/downside.png\" alt=\"Component Hell\" /> \n</p>\n\nYou would most certainly end up with something like this. The end result is not pretty but it is sure as hell very powerful.\n\nWhen building a core business feature, take this pattern into account. It could save you a lot of time and resources.\n\n";
